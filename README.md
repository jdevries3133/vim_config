My vim configuration. This is really easy to setup, just clone it into
`~/.vim` on your system, install
[Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager, and
finally install all the plugins with the `:PlugInstall` command.

This is a pretty minimal configuration;
[my nvim configuration](https://github.com/jdevries3133/nvim_config/) extends
this configuration, and is much more IDE-like if that is your cup of tea.
